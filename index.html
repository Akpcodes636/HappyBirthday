            <h3>You're the best mother, sister, wife, teacher, and Sunday school teacher </h3>anyone of us could ever have asked for! Year after year, I watch you give yourself fully for your family, friends, and job. You're a hard worker, humble, a selfless giver, full of wisdom and love.  Lol, yes, you still shout at Tega a lot [;)]  This is only here for jokes, of course. I wouldn't trade you for anything.
